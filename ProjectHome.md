Nieme is a machine learning library for large-scale classification, regression and ranking. It relies on the framework of energy-based models which unifies several learning algorithms. This framework also unifies batch and stochastic learning which are both seen as energy minimization problems. Nieme is released under the GPL license. It is efficiently implemented in C++ and works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Interfaces are available for C++, Java and Python.
